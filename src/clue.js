/* Clue has three different card types: suspects, rooms, and weapons.

Let's create an array for every card type. These arrays should be named suspectsArray, weaponsArray, roomsArray. Each array will contain objects, 
where each object represents one card.

All of the information you need about suspects, rooms, and weapons can be found on the DATA.md file.

Suggestion: Copy this data into the clue.js file and model it into objects nested inside your cards arrays. This is a great chance for you to experiment with IDE shortcuts, multiple-line selection, find and replace, and other great features that VS Code provides.
