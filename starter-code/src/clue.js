// Do you remember the classic detective board game Clue? It was a very popular game in the 90's.

// The plot starts with the death of Mr. Boddy, the very wealthy owner of Tudor Manor. He was killed under highly suspicious circumstances, and it's the players mission to uncover which suspect murdered him, what weapon was used, and in which room of the mansion the crime took place.

// When playing Clue, these three details are represented by a suspect card, a weapon card and a room card that are kept hidden in an envelope for the duration of the game. By progressively revealing the remaining cards, the players can infer which are the three cards that are hidden. When a player is confident that they know the solution to the mystery, they will try to reveal it. If a player guesses correctly, they win the game.

// ITERATION 1
// Clue has three different card types: suspects, rooms, and weapons. We'll be given the same amount of information for any given card with the same card type.

// As such, let's create an array for every card type, that is going contain the objects representing each card. These arrays should be named suspectsArray, weaponsArray, roomsArray.

// Suspects Collection
